This repository contains my practice exercises for understanding and implementing recursion. It includes two main HTML files:

1. `MergeSort.html`
2. `fibonacci.html`

## Files

### 1. MergeSort.html

This file demonstrates the Merge Sort algorithm implemented using recursion. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively splitting the array into halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together.

### 2. fibonacci.html

This file illustrates the calculation of Fibonacci numbers using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.
